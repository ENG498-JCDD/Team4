# Evictions and Rent in North Carolina (2019-2024)
North Carolina renters are under pressure. Eviction filings jumped and many cases are granted, as shown in [Mecklenburg’s FY24 report](https://mecklenburghousingdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Key-Findings_Housing-Instability_Charlotte-Mecklenburg-State-of-Housing-Instability-and-Homelessness-Report-2024.pdf) (37% more filings; 65% granted). Rents have risen since 2019 (about +38% for a modest 2-bedroom), while wages haven’t kept up everywhere. At the same time, large investors own a growing share of homes and apartments, which many local reports connect to affordability strain. State analysts also show cost burdens rising across urban and rural NC.

## Hypothesis

North Carolina faces statewide housing stress: high evictions, fast-rising rents, and uneven access to mortgages for some groups. These patterns grew out of pandemic-era price spikes, limited tenant support, and ownership trends that reduced affordable options. If nothing changes, displacement and the racial wealth gap will grow.

### Specifying Questions

1. Where in North Carolina are eviction filings and grants most concentrated, and who is most affected?
2. Are mortgage denial and pricing gaps higher for Black/Latino borrowers than for white borrowers at similar incomes in NC?
3. Since 2020, by how much have rents outpaced wages in NC?
