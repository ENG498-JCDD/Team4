# Analysis Folder

This folder contains analysis notebooks for each specifying question. Each notebook takes cleaned data and answers the research question through exploratory analysis and calculations.

## What Goes Here

Analysis notebooks (`.md` files) that:
- Load cleaned data from the `data/` folder
- Calculate key statistics and metrics to answer the specifying question
- Test hypotheses and explore patterns based on what was shared in your "Data Design Project - Analysis Flow" google doc

Analysis notebooks are the **computational work**—they generate the numbers and insights that report pages will tell stories about.
