### About the ACS 5-Year Estimates

Started in 2010, the Census Bureau releases *5-year averages estimates* for all geographic areas, regardless of population size. 

- Data collected over a 5-year period of time and therefore they describe the average characteristics for that 5-year time period. 
- Geographic areas in 5-year averages estimates are available for every state, county, city, town, place, American Indian Area, Alaska Native Area, and Hawaiian Home Land, as well as for census tracts and block groups. 
- 5-yr Estimates replace estimates from the decennial census long form started in 2010.

### Data Notes

- Beginning in 2011, the Zip Code Tabulation Areas have been added as one of the geographic levels, and they are only in the US national level file.
